# x/globalfee

Find the detailed spec of the module [here](./spec/README.md)

In the realm of blockchain and code,
A cosmos-sdk network abode,
Where validators can set gas prices low,
Or high, as part of node configuration's show.

In config/app.toml, it's all set,
Minimum gas prices with no regret,
For transactions to pass and succeed,
Or fail if gas prices don't take heed.

But what if gas prices are set to zero,
And transactions fly without a peso?
x/globalfee module comes to the rescue,
Enforcing gas fees, transactions to construe.

With the module's implementation in place,
Network can set free gas in some space,
On specific contracts that require it,
No gas fees for these, the network will permit.

Governance on-chain or whitelisted address,
Can update this configuration with finesse,
For the network to keep the gas flowing,
And ensure transactions keep going.

So here we have a tale of gas fees,
And modules to enforce them with ease,
In a cosmos-sdk blockchain network,
Ensuring transactions always work.
